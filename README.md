## Tunisian Sign Language Detection Model

This repository contains a model for detecting Tunisian Sign Language gestures. The model is designed to classify various hand signs used in Tunisian Sign Language.

### Dataset

The dataset used to train this model was created by Ameni LAIFI and Zeineb SOUISSI. It includes a variety of hand sign images representing different gestures in Tunisian Sign Language.

### Data Labeling and Image Augmentation

To prepare the dataset for training, it is recommended to use Roboflow for data labeling and image augmentation. Roboflow provides efficient tools for annotating images with bounding boxes or segmentation masks, as well as for augmenting the data to improve model performance.

### Training Process

Once the dataset is labeled and augmented using Roboflow, the next step is to import the folder containing the data to your Google Drive or preferred cloud storage. This facilitates access to the dataset during the training process.
